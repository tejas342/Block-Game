This is a 3D Block Game created with Unity. It was created during my learning phase. Hope you'll play it!!



In this Game you have to move your block till end point.
You can control it with standard ARROW-KEYS and W,S,A,D.
I learned Basic Collision, Color







Any hinderance caused should be forgiven as that time was learning phase.
