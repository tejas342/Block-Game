This is a 3D Block Game created with Unity. It was created during my learning phase. Hope you'll play it!!


In this Game you have to move your block till end point.
You can control it with standard ARROW-KEYS and W,S,A,D.

I learned Basic Collision, little bit of Physics System, player Movement, Basic Coding in C#.
# Code
The code written in dropper.cs enables gravity.
The code written in scorer.cs is used to count score but it can only be shown in Unity Editor.
The code written in objectHit.cs is based on Collision.
The code written in playerMovement.cs enables movament of player.
The code written in dropper.cs enables gravity.
The code written in spinner.cs enables rotation of object.



Any hinderance caused should be forgiven as that time was learning phase.
